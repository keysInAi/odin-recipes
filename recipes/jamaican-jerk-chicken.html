    <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>Whoo child! Jerk chicken is as Jamaican as they come. This dish when done correctly represents the people of Jamaica. I like to say "A lot of spice but everything nice." No for real, Jerk chicken is a spicy dish but it is so delicious.</p>  
        <p>If you are lucky enough to travel to Jamaica, you can get Jerk Chicken at jerk huts all over the island. I personally recommend Border Jerk Hut. It is to die for. 
            Anyways, Jerk represents a way of cooking that's popular in Jamaica. The meat and/or vegetables are in a paste that must include allspice and scotch bonnet peppers. It is then slow cooked and smoked over pimento wood.
        I'm telling you the flavor the pimento wood imparts on the meat/vegetables is something special.</p>
        <p>Ok that's enough. Let's get into this delicious recipe!</p>
