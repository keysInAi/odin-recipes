            <li>1 leaf of Chinese broccoli</li>

            <li>Slice 1/4 of the small white onion into medium strips</li>
            <li>Dice 3-4 green onions</li>

            <li>Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, a pinch of sugar and continue stir frying your rice, making surw all the sauce gets mixed in</li>
            <li>Add your Chinese broccoli and onions, stir fry for another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt a bit</li>
            <li>Lastly toss in your green onions, stir for a few more seconds and then you're done</li>
            <li>Slice a few wedges of lime and serve it on a plate next to the rice</li>
